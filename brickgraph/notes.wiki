= Graph Definition =

basic ontology:
- entities
- deployments
- processes:
    - controllers
- resources:
    - URIS
    - namespaces

What does this representation afford us?:
- does the existing WAVE graph meet these permissions?:
    - requires visibility into all entities...
- what processes should exist?:
    - needs config information embedded in the graph
    - driver type/URL (standard installation?)
    - IP address, user/pass? (would keep this protected)
- this tells us what entities + permissions to create:
    - entities for sure: one per process. Process label gives us the entity name
    - we cannot generate the permission structure:
        - unless the entity running this process has permissions
        - we can generate the 1-hop structure
